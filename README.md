# 🔐 Classical Cipher Command-Line App

A Python command-line application that performs encryption and decryption using **classical cipher algorithms** — specifically a combination of **substitution** and **transposition** techniques.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Choose from 3 substitution algorithms:
  - **Caesar Cipher**
  - **Affine Cipher**
  - **Vigenère Cipher**
- ✅ Choose from 3 transposition algorithms:
  - **Rail Fence Cipher**
  - **Columnar Transposition Cipher**
  - **Route Cipher**
- ✅ Perform encryption/decryption based on your selected combo
- ✅ Verify correctness by reversing the operation

## 🧠 Algorithms Explained

### 🌀 Substitution Ciphers
- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts each letter by a fixed number. (A → D if shift = 3)
- **Affine Cipher**: Mixes letters with a math formula (fancy Caesar).
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Uses a word to decide how much each letter shifts.

### 🧩 Transposition Ciphers
- **Rail Fence**: Zigzag writing pattern. Rearranges letters in a rail-like path.
- **Columnar**: Writes letters in columns, reorders them based on a keyword.
- **Route**: Puts letters in a grid and follows a specific path to read them.
